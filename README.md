# Clean Code - Robert C. Martin

   - Not a **feel good** book.
   - Learning Craftsmanship:
      - Knowledge (principles, patterns, practices, heuristics)
      - Work (Hard work, must sweat over it, watch others fail).

## Chapter 1: Clean Code

   1. ***There Will Be Code***
   
      ####
      -  We will never be rid of code (because code represents the details of the requirements and can not be ignored or abstracted, they have to be **specific**).
      -  Machines will not adapt what we need. So **there will always be code**.
      ####
   
   2. ***Bad Code***

      ####
      - Trying to go fast? In a rush?
      - Tired of working on a program and want it to be over ?
      - You choose to leave it for another day? 
      - Feel relief of seeing the messy program work?
      - Feel **working mess is better than nothing**?
      - But ... **Later equals never**!
      ####
   
   3. ***The Total Cost of Owning a Mess***

      ####
      Over time the mess becomes so big and deep and so tall, we can not clean it up. There is no way at all.

      Driving the productivity ever further toward ZERO
      ####

      3.1. ***The Grand Redesign in the Sky***
      ####
      3.2. ***Attitude***
      
      ####
      - If you don't do what the manager says, you'll be fired? Probably not!
      - Like a doctor with a durty hand? 
      - So too it's unprofessional for programmers to bend to **the will of managers who don't really understand the risks of making messes.**
      ####

      3.3. ***The Primal Conundrum*** [Primitive]
      ####
      The only way to make the deadline - the only way to go fast - is to keep the code as clean as possible at all times.
      ####

      3.4. ***The Art of Clean Code***
      ####
      - A programmer ***without "code-sense"*** can look at a messy module and recognize the mess *but will have no idea what to do about it.*
      #####
      - A programmer ***with "code-sense"*** will look at a messt module and see *OPTIONS & VARIATIONS*
      #####
      - In short, a programmer who writes clean code is an artist who can take a blank screen through a series of transformations **until it is an elegantly coded system.**
      ####

      3.5. ***What Is Clean Code?***
      ####
      - Some keywords: *elegant, efficient, straightforward logic, does one thing, simple, direct, well-written prose, create tensions, can be read, enhance by others, one way rather than many ways for doing one thing, proper error handling, clear and minimal API, CARE, runs all the tests, no duplication, minimize the number of entities (classes, methods, functions), make it looks like a language was made for the problem, make it simple as hell =))*
      ####

   4. ***School of Thought***
      ####
      - There are other school, other masters out there that have as much claim to professionalism as this book authors.
      - Something would be very controversial. Probably not agree with all of them.
      - The recommendations in this book are things they have thought long and hard about. They have learned them through decades of exprience and repeated trial and error. Thus, **whether you agree or disagree. it would be a shame if you did not see, and respect, their point of view.**
      ####

   5. ***We Are Authors***
      ####
      - Basically, authors are responsible for communicating well with their readers. The next time you write a line of code, remember you are an author, writing for readers who will judge your effort.
      - *The code you are trying to write today will be hard or easy to write depending on how hard or easy the surrounding code is to read. So if you want to go fast, if you want to get done quickly, **if you want your code to be easy to write, make it easy to read***
      ####

   6. ***The Boy Scout Rule***
      ####
      **"Leave the campground cleaner than you found it"**
      ####
      - It's not enough to write the code well. The code has to be kept clean over time. We've all seen code **rot** and **degrade** as time passes.
      - Checked-in our code a litter cleaner than we checked it out. -> not rot anymore
         - Change one variable name for the better
         - Break up one function that's a little too large
         - Eliminate one small bit of duplication
         - Clean up one composite *if* statement
      ####

   7. ***Conclusion***
      ####
      - This book can not make you a good programmer. Can not give the "code-sense"
      - **This book shows the thought processes, the tricks, techniques, and tools**
      - You will se good code and you will see bad code. You will see bad code transformed into good code.
      - You will see lists of heuristics, disciplines and techniques.
      - You will see a butt-load of code, example after example.
      - **PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT !!!**
